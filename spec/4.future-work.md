# Future Work

Mantra is a draft and there may be a lot of missing pieces and improvements we can do. We've currently identified the following features as important to Mantra and will be available in near future.

## Mantra Modules

Mantra modules will help you put actions, UI components and containers related to a common functionality into a single place. You can publish them to NPM and share with others.

Note: We don't have a proper way to do this now. Try experimenting and [share](https://github.com/kadirahq/mantra/issues/3) your experience with us.

## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

It's extremely possible to do SSR with Mantra. We are trying to do this in a tool agnostic manner, but the reference implementation will be based on FlowRouter SSR.
