# Core Components

Here are the core components of Mantra.

## Server Side

Mantra focuses a lot on the client side, because that's where you write a lot of code. We allow client-side caches and connectors to interact with the server and remote data layers.

However, we have a set of standards on structuring the file layout in the server.

Note: All the following Mantra components reside in the client side of your app.

## ES2015 Syntax and ES2015 Modules

We rely on different features of ES2015 and its module system. In order to use Mantra, you need to use [Meteor 1.3](https://forums.meteor.com/t/meteor-1-3-early-beta-now-available/14723), which comes with an implementation of the ES2015 module system.

## React as the UI

We use React as the UI (presentation) layer in Mantra. You should pass all the data, event handlers and library functions via props.

You could handle the React state inside a component, but that should not interact with the rest of your app. Therefore, Mantra highly recommends you avoid using states.

When writing your UI components, you can include any other React component. Here are a few places you can import React components:

* Other UI components you define in your app
* UI components from NPM (like meterial-ui).
Any Containers in your app (we'll talk about this in a moment)

Any other thing to the component should be passed via props.

## Actions

Actions are the place where you write the **business logic** in your app. This includes:

* Validations
* State Management
* Interacting with Remote Data Sources

An action is a simple function that accepts the first argument as the whole [application context](#sec-Application-Context) in your app. Other arguments usually come when invoking them from the UI or inside the container.

Note: Inside an action, everything you do should be based on applications context and other arguments passed to the action. You should not require other modules or use Global variables inside actions or the module action stays.

## State Management

In an app, we need to deal with different kinds of states. We can divide them into two different categories:

1. Local State - State in the client-side app that will never be synced with a remote server (Errors, validation messages, current page)
2. Remote State - This is the state usually fetched from a remote server and synced with it.

We have different solutions to manage states in our app, including:

* Meteor/MiniMongo (Remote State)
* Tracker/ReactiveDict (Local State)
* FlowRouter (Local State)
* Redux (Local State)
* GraphQL/Lokka (Remote State)
* GraphQL/Relay (Remote State)
* Falcor (Remote State)

This is the place where a lot of innovation is happening in the JavaScript community. So, Mantra is flexible when it comes to state management. You can use anything you want.

For example, you can use the following for your app when starting:

* Meteor/MiniMongo (Remote State)
* Tracker/ReactiveDict (Local State)
* FlowRouter (Local State)

Later on you can move on to different solutions.

Note: However, Mantra enforces a few rules when managing your states.

* Any write operations to states should be done inside an action
* You can read states in both actions and containers
* You should not read or write into states directly inside UI components. UI components should know nothing about states in your app.

See the following links for some sample usage of states:

* [Reading from local state - inside a container](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/containers/newpost.js#L8)
* [Writing into local state - inside an action](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/actions/posts.js#L7)
* [Reading from a remote state - inside a container](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/containers/postlist.js#L8)

## Containers

Containers are the integration layer in Mantra. They do the following:

* pass states into UI components
* pass actions into UI components
* pass any configuration item or library function in the application context

A container is a React component, but you are not directly creating it. You should not use JSX inside the container module.

Containers are normally composed using a library like [react-komposer](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-komposer). It supports different data sources, including Meteor/Tracker, Promises, Rx.js Observable and nearly anything else.

Normally, inside a container you need to write the following functions:

* composer functions to get data from states
* mapper function to get data from dependency injection layer and map it to props

We have some rules for this:

* All these function should be exported from the container module
* Composer functions should only use variables coming via props
* The mapper function should only use variables coming as arguments. It has access to your whole application context and actions.

Note: If you need to pass the application context to a component, do it via props using a mapper.

## Application Context

Application Context is available to all the actions and containers, so this is the place for shared variables in your app. These include:

* Meteor namespace
* Meteor Collections
* LocalState
* FlowRouter
* Any other Meteor package
* Redux Stores
* Lokka Client
* Rest Client

## Dependency Injection

Mantra uses dependency injection to isolate different parts of your app including UI components and actions.

We use a project called [`react-simple-di`](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-simple-di) that uses React Context behind the scene. It accepts both application context and actions as dependencies. 

Once configured, application context will be injected into each action. That's the first argument of an action. So, you don't need to pass the application context manually.

### Configuring Dependency Injections

Dependencies will be injected to the top-level components in your app. This could be a Layout component.

## Routing & Component Mounting

Note: Here, when referring to components, we will consider both containers and UI components.

We normally use a Router to mount components into the UI. There could be multiple solutions (for example, FlowRouter and React Router).

The Router's only functionality in Mantra is to mount components to the UI. It's just a tool.

Click [here](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/configs/routes.jsx) to see how you can use FlowRouter and React Layout to mount components.

## Single Entry Point

In Mantra, we want the app to be predictable. Therefore, there is only a single entry point in your app. Usually, it will load routes.

[Click here for an example entry point.](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/main.js)

Note: For the server, you can have a separate entry point.

## Libraries

Every app has some utility functions to do different tasks. You can also get them via NPM. In Mantra, libraries should be provided to any part of your app via the application context. For that, we can have a field called `libs` that contains all of them.

## Testing

Testing is a core part of Mantra. Mantra helps you to test every part of your application. Rules we've enforced help you to write those tests. You can use familiar tools like Mocha, Chai and Sinon to do testing.

With Mantra, you can unit test three core parts in your app:

* UI components - [Example](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/components/post/tests/index.js)
* Actions - [Example](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/actions/tests/posts.js)
* Container composers and deps mappers - [Example](https://github.com/mantrajs/mantra-sample-blog-app/blob/master/client/containers/tests/post.js)

### UI Testing

For the UI testing we use [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme). Click here to see some sample test cases.
