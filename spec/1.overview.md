# Overview

Mantra is an application architecture for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). With Mantra, we try to achieve two main goals.

**1. High Maintainability**

Maintainability is a key factor for success when working with a large team. We achieve this by unit testing every part of our app, while following standards for everything. Then it's easy to on-board new users and work with teams.

**2. Future Proof**

JavaScript is a land of choices. We have more than one best thing for each problem. It can be hard to tell whatâ€™s the best solution now and what will change in the future.

Mantra relies on a set of core principles that will last for a long time. Then, we let others to change as needed.

## What's inside Mantra?

* It has a modern React-based **UI component** layer. 
* It has a place to define business logic in your app. We call them **actions**.
* State management is not provided by Mantra itself, but it allows you to use a wide variety of state managers including Meteor/Tracker, Redux, Rx.js Observables, Promises and nearly anything else.
* It has a way to integrate both states and actions into UI components by composing containers.
* It allows you to inject dependencies.
* It helps you to unit test UI, actions and integrations (containers).
* It has standards on directory layout, file naming and everything else. 

## What Mantra is not?

* It's not an application framework. An application framework takes care of bundling, network transport, deployment, etc. Mantra uses Meteor as the application framework.
* It's not a boilerplate, even though we have a directory structure. 
* It's not a code generator. We may have a code generation tool, but that's not a core part of Mantra.

## Why a Spec?

Mantra is an application architecture. There will be a lot of stakeholders for Mantra including app developers, tool builders, tutorial authors and project managers, so it's very important to have a common standard everyone follows. That's what this specification does.

## Before You Read

This specification is written in a simple language. However, you may feel more comfortable if you have a sound knowledge of the following areas.

* ES2015
* React
* React Containers
* Meteor Basics (Pub/Sub, Tracker, ReactiveDict, etc.)

Refer [Appendix A](#sec-Appendix-A-Prerequisite) to learn more about the above areas.
